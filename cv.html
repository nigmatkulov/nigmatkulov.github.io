    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Experimental physicist specializing in high-energy collisions and next-generation detector technologies. Active participant of the CMS at the LHC, STAR and ePIC at BNL.
      Passionate about science communication and mentoring early-career scientists. My work bridges fundamental research and real-world impact through innovation in data analysis.
      A significant portion of my research focuses on applying statistical analysis, programming expertise, and high-precision simulations to study particle detectors and interaction processes.
